## Testing of automation of team selection

Purpose of project is to determine if there is a suitable way of automating my fantasy hockey team

Using the data for the last 7 days of the player, how did they perform?

Compute all combination of teams and the various positions of the players to calculate what the idea mix would be to determine the AVERAGE best team.
Functionally rank each position from 1-n then calculate that teams ranking by the average of all fields.

Final output is the combination that may result in the best team. Often more then one, usually a permutation of split position players shuffling around.

Should recommend the Best team and identify players that are positioned on the bench for all team combinations

## Future

would like to loop all the additional combinations until i can't determine a better one

How do i mix the impact of the categories on how the rankings are applied? Can i shift it up or down for a column depending on an input such as point differences, etc.

automate the waiver claim process to send these players through. Maybe set a list of 4-5 players to evaluate their impact? 

What about the teams that the player is going to play against? how might that impact the individual considerations?
